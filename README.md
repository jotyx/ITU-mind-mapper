## Bugs:
- [x] svg width and height not working with zoom
- [ ] map selection is based on name - name collision causing that map's edits are applied to both and both are selected in top panel
- [ ] resize node collision detection

## TODO:
- [x] **placeholder** <del>rejected</del>
- [x] set size of node
- [x] image export
- [ ] persist map on refresh
    - [x] load testing map from file
- [ ] Help pop up
    - [ ] remove "Storno" button
- [ ] hide node option (?? how to show it back)
- [ ] rename on double click
- [ ] DnD

## Ideas:
- [ ] more fluent colour combinations - https://coolors.co/
- [ ] disable - node is unselected on second click
- [ ] remove frame colour picker (set to the same colour as node background colour)
- [ ] a new node should be without default text or this text should be removed on edit
